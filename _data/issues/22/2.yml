          Using the mixed media of sketch notes, animation, and voiceover, this video explores the
          field of compositionâ€™s relationship between multimodality and composing. The piece
          illustrates how multimodal strategies such as sketchnotes can enhance idea generation and
          learning and provide classroom stategies for multimodal composition.

          POOC assignments enable students to step in and out of different important economies that
          interact in a post-truthy world: the attention economy (engaging viewers with content),
          information economy (finding info to create the university), reputation economy
          (developing ethos), and trust economy (learning how to trust others by vetting).

          This project challenges the dominant narrative a state university utilizes to describe its
          namesake. The project curates a selection of primary source documents set in juxtaposition
          to myriad other texts, images, and videos, all working in conjunction to complicate the
          scene of learning at this university and in this state.

          Health literacy is an embodied, multisensory experience that is invariably mediated by
          healthcare technologies. We illustrate this concept through three case studies that
          describe scenarios in which non-experts and lay experts engage in non-discursive literacy
          practices: parents caring for an infant in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), people
          with type 1 diabetes (T1D) self-managing their treatment, and public audiences reporting
          symptoms to a crowd-sourced flu-tracking program.

          Distant reading and related data-driven methodologies illuminate previously unrecognized
          trends in how the discipline of English has incorporated, resisted, and naturalized new
          media technologies.

          Using anonymous, location-based social media applications in the writing classroom can
          heighten student awareness of other situational factors online, such as time, place, and
          feeling. By engaging with student posts and their accompanying reflections, this text
          argues for the use of anonymous social media applications in our pedagogy to help students
          engage ethically in digital spaces.

          This webtext explores the educational and social potential of Alternate Reality Games
          (ARGs) by describing and analyzing the design, curriculum, and objectives of an ARG
          entitled S.E.E.D. This webtext uses some of the transmedia assets that made the game
          itself possible, as well as video documentation of the game, to provide an account of this
          genre and its affordances.

          In this webtext, we share our experiences in a new media graduate course in which students
          played and experimented with littleBits (modular circuitry designed for easy invention).
          Modular three-dimensional objects provide opportunities to introduce new media to students
          in ways that disrupt their conventional practices of invention, provide opportunities to
          explore rhetorical practice as play, and refigure creation as remix and craft.
